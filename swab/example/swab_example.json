"target": "届时他们可以利用资料区进一步了解对方。"}, {"id": 361, "target": "我们提供了一个相对安静隐私的环境空间，我认为这样安排很合适，你觉得呢？"}, {"id": 364, "target": "这个方案不错。关于上午，核心目的是观察大家的整体状态。如果上午的效果不佳，我们担心中午用餐后可能有人会提早离场，从而影响气氛。"}, {"id": 366, "target": "这个没有关系。因为我们的活动本质上是自愿参与性质的，首先它是......"}, {"id": 367, "target": "相互认识，对吧。"}, {"id": 368, "target": "确实，首先它提供了一个自由的社交环境。"}, {"id": 369, "target": "这个环节并不特别复杂。"}, {"id": 379, "target": "活动是自由的。活动安排在下午三点半开始，届时我们将返回主会场。在那里，我们准备了一项互动游戏，旨在进一步营造气氛。"}, {"id": 380, "target": "你是指它能促进参与者之间关系的什么？"}, {"id": 383, "target": "游戏旨在增进参与者的亲密感，具体游戏是踩气球。"}, {"id": 394, "target": "游戏规则是这样的：两人一组，男女配对。每一对参与者将彼此的左脚和右脚绑在一起，并且两个人的脚上绑一个气球，他们要互相搀扶，共同去踩破气球。"}, {"id": 395, "target": "这是一种相互鼓励和支持的游戏，不是吗？"}, {"id": 403, "target": "是的，通过共同努力踩破气球。比如说，此次活动共有十组参与，即二十位参与者，每组由一男一女组成。我们将关注最后哪一组踩的气球最多。"}, {"id": 405, "target": "这个活动具有一定的紧张感。"}, {"id": 406, "target": "此外，活动中还体现了团队合作的默契。"}, {"id": 408, "target": "通过两人的协作，这项活动也促进了参与者间的亲密度。"}, {"id": 410, "target": "踩气球游戏确实是个不错的选择。"}, {"id": 417, "target": "考虑到参与者的年轻特点，建议将活动安排在上午及下午，晚上则无需安排活动，便于参与者自由支配时间。结束后，参与者可以自由交换联系方式，自行安排后续活动。这样的安排是可行的。"}, {"id": 418, "target": "说这个还早，目前讨论的是踩气球活动的流程，没有必要提及晚上的安排。"}, {"id": 420, "target": "确实，我们正在讨论整个活动的流程安排。"}, {"id": 425, "target": "整个活动结束后，我们会特别设置一个时间点以便于参与者安排后续活动，特别是考虑到有加班或住得较远的参与者，确保他们能够妥善安排时间。"}, {"id": 427, "target": "考虑到有整整一天的时间安排，我们将包括踩气球游戏在内的各项活动进行了合理规划。"}, {"id": 431, "target": "踩气球游戏将于下午三点半开始，预计进行到五点，或者四点半左右结束。这个游戏被安排了一个小时的时间，以便于分组进行。"}, {"id": 435, "target": "在分组完成后，参与者将开始游戏，最终将决出前三名。对于获得一、二、三名的参与者，我们准备了奖品。"}, {"id": 438, "target": "至于奖品的设置，届时你可以进行选择。筛选一些合适的奖品。"}, {"id": 440, "target": "关于奖品的选择，如果你有任何建议，请提出。不要总是期待我来决定，我们也希望听到你的意见。"}, {"id": 445, "target": "奖品的选择可以围绕当前年轻人的喜好，例如iPhone或iPad等流行物品，毕竟难得大家参与活动。其实这些礼品应该是好选的，因为年轻人都喜欢这类手表、iPad、苹果产品。"}, {"id": 447, "target": "不过，我们也要考虑预算限制。虽然我们希望本次活动的奖品令人满意，但必须在预算范围内进行选择。"}, {"id": 448, "target": "我们当然要考虑预算。"}, {"id": 450, "target": "对于礼品，我更注重的不是其价值，而是它所承载的纪念意义。"}, {"id": 452, "target": "谈及纪念意义，我们需要思考当前年轻人还需何种东西。在促成两人相遇的过程中，并不必然需要奖品。"}, {"id": 453, "target": "是的。"}, {"id": 463, "target": "关键在于激发每个人的参与热情和积极性，这并非取决于礼品的重要性。你有关于礼品的建议和想法吗？需要一些比较具体的建议。"}, {"id": 464, "target": "我的意思是，你似乎还未提出任何具体的建议。"}, {"id": 466, "target": "并不是我未提出具体建议，而是我们还没能深入讨论出具体的方案。"}, {"id": 467, "target": "你认为这是预算的问题，还是有其他考虑？"}, {"id": 469, "target": "其实这只是我的一个建议，你完全可以提出你的见解。我们之间不存在任何分歧，我们只是在......"}, {"id": 473, "target": "确实如此。正如我之前所述，年轻人喜欢的东西，比如iPad、苹果等产品。让我们探讨关于电子产品的议题。"}, {"id": 474, "target": "是的。"}, {"id": 479, "target": "例如，一对男女成功牵手了，你赠送洋娃娃作为纪念似乎不如提供电子设备来的更有意义，因为这些设备能为他们的日常生活带来便利。"}, {"id": 480, "target": "这是一个相当不错的提议。"}, {"id": 481, "target": "你看，这样他们会有一种感觉。"}, {"id": 483, "target": "确实，考虑到实用性是关键，与那些往日流行的洋娃娃不同。"}, {"id": 490, "target": "是的。现在洋娃娃随处可买，甚至他们自己出去玩就可以买到。我们的目标是让这些参与者通过我们的活动获得更多便利。我认为这样的合作如果延续到未来，肯定能够扩展更多机会。"}, {"id": 495, "target": "下一次活动时有人会给好的反馈，说上次参加的这个活动还不错，那么我们有责任确保本次活动的高质量执行。这意味着，我们需要对细节和礼品的安排给予特别的关注与精心策划。这样不只是......"}, {"id": 502, "target": "我理应向同仁们，特别是领导，报告有实际意义的结果。否则，我们此次会议讨论的意义又在哪里呢？"}, {"id": 511, "target": "因此，我们需要详细规划，包括细节安排。同时，我们还得考虑如何向领导申请经费，尽管这事相对容易处理。关键的是，如果决定要举办这次活动，我们必须确保办得出色，以便收获好的反响，否则将无法向领导交待。"}, {"id": 515, "target": "既然你这么提议，我认为我们可以考虑将电子产品，如iPad和iPhone，作为礼品，它们既实用又符合年轻人的喜好。"}, {"id": 516, "target": "确实如此。"}, {"id": 521, "target": "此外，我还有一个建议。目前成都有许多手工定制礼品，我计划采购一批。"}, {"id": 522, "target": "哦，你是指DIY产品，手工艺品是吗？"}, {"id": 528, "target": "不是，我指的是那些手工绘制的定制品，它们工艺精美，非常适合作为礼物。我认为选择的时候，我们可以挑选即使放置在家中，也可以作为装饰物的精美工艺品。"}, {"id": 529, "target": "打断一下，实际上关于工艺品的问题，我认为另外一种方式或许更合适。"}, {"id": 540, "target": "事实上，我们应该探索其他可能性。比如，我们可以看看是否有认识或稍微熟悉的人，可以在网络上寻找手工技艺精湛的工匠。例如，可以邀请一位手工艺师傅来引领现场活动，特别是如果有些参与者愿意尝试DIY工艺品制作，例如医院中的护士等。女孩子们通常对此类活动更感兴趣。"}, {"id": 546, "target": "我们可以让参与者跟随师傅学习相关技艺，这不仅适用于女士们，男士们同样可以加入学习。通过这种方式，我们可以促进更多的互动与交流，这比简单地向参与者赠送现成的工艺品或让他们自己制作更有益。你可能会问，为什么要在现场学习制作工艺品？这是因为现场DIY活动能够营造更佳的交流氛围。"}, {"id": 548, "target": "不，你偏离了主题。你的意思是把这个DIY加到游戏环节里面吗？"}, {"id": 549, "target": "是的，将DIY环节并入游戏中，这样可以使大家的互动更加自然。"}, {"id": 550, "target": "加入游戏环节。"}, {"id": 551, "target": "您想，自己动手制作与购买成品赠予他人相比......"}, {"id": 553, "target": "我理解了您的意思。"}, {"id": 555, "target": "那种体验完全不同，甚至还能促进现场的男士和女士之间的交流，一起学习和制作。"}, {"id": 557, "target": "这个建议是相当不错的。"}, {"id": 558, "target": "这应该是一个很好的点子，因为......"}, {"id": 559, "target": "我明白了。"}, {"id": 560, "target": "我。"}, {"id": 561, "target": "没错，正是这样。"}, {"id": 566, "target": "仔细思考后，我认为让年轻人参与制作意义深远的事物非常重要。他们不仅能从中获得成就感，还能制作出生活中实用的物品。我认为这方面来说会稍微好一些的。"}, {"id": 568, "target": "是的，关于这一点，但我们还需要考虑活动的时间安排。"}, {"id": 570, "target": "让我检查一下预计的流程和时间。"}, {"id": 571, "target": "是的，我们需要进行一下时间计算。"}, {"id": 572, "target": "关于踩气球游戏。"}, {"id": 575, "target": "预计活动将于上午十点开始，参与者会陆续到达。由于有些人可能会晚睡或延迟，这是很常见的情况。"}, {"id": 576, "target": "可以将你刚刚的提议留到最后讨论。"}, {"id": 579, "target": "活动定于下午一点开始，但不能延续得太晚，以免影响那些需要提早离开的或者是......"}, {"id": 581, "target": "活动初期，我们将制作并发送邀请函，其中会明确活动的具体时间。"}, {"id": 582, "target": "是的，你需要在邀请函中明确说明活动的时间。"}, {"id": 584, "target": "活动将从上午十点开始，至下午五点半结束。"}, {"id": 585, "target": "是的，正是这样。"}, {"id": 586, "target": "五点结束，我们安排了中午的用餐。"}, {"id": 596, "target": "整个时间安排需包括联谊活动的具体时间、用餐时间等，这需要提前进行周密的规划。如果时间安排不恰当，可能会导致参与者分散到达或提前离场，进而错失相遇的机会。"}, {"id": 598, "target": "我们会在邀请函中注明，活动从上午十点开始入场到下午五点半结束。"}, {"id": 599, "target": "上午十点入场。"}, {"id": 601, "target": "考虑到三圣乡地区，下午五点半结束的时间较为合适，我们不会安排晚餐。中午将提供用餐，活动在下午结束后，五点半的时间也恰好适宜。"}, {"id": 602, "target": "参与者离开后，一些人表示愿意自行安排在家用餐。"}, {"id": 603, "target": "对于愿意约见的人，他们可以自己安排时间。此时，我们的活动已经圆满结束，剩下的便是他们自行私下联系。"}, {"id": 605, "target": "确实，他们会自行决定。"}, {"id": 608, "target": "因此，整体问题的关键在于何处？在于再次邀请。"}, {"id": 612, "target": "关键在于如何在过程中促进他们的相识和更好的互动，以便有一个更深入的了解。请你提出一些建议。"}, {"id": 613, "target": "提出建议并非问题所在，重点是我们自早上开始就已经在讨论相关内容。"}, {"id": 614, "target": "是的。"}, {"id": 615, "target": "我们讨论了哪些游戏、活动或者用餐安排等问题？"}, {"id": 616, "target": "其实我已经概述了整个流程。"}, {"id": 617, "target": "因此，我们现在需要详细讨论这些安排。"}, {"id": 620, "target": "不，问题的焦点在于之前讨论的奖品设置。"}, {"id": 628, "target": "确实，还有其他议题需要探讨吗？关于DIY手工艺品的环节以及你提出的建议，这需要参与者独立完成。我们计划将这个游戏环节融入活动中，因此我们需要对时间表作出相应的调整。目前的讨论重点是解决这一问题。"}, {"id": 630, "target": "确实如此，当前的安排是从早晨至晚间的时间表。"}, {"id": 632, "target": "无需调整早上的部分，保持不变。"}, {"id": 633, "target": "那早上的时间，具体是从几点到几点？"}, {"id": 635, "target": "下午的时间安排我已经提过了，我一开始就提到过。"}, {"id": 636, "target": "那请再说一次吧，确认一遍无妨。"}, {"id": 637, "target": "早上十点开始入场。"}, {"id": 638, "target": "好的，十点签到。"}, {"id": 639, "target": "十点半，领导发表致辞。"}, {"id": 641, "target": "是的，开场是在十点半，先领导致辞。"}, {"id": 643, "target": "不，首先十点半由主持人开场，随后是乐队表演。"}, {"id": 644, "target": "明白了。"}, {"id": 645, "target": "乐队将在十点半至十一点间表演，随后主持人介绍环节。"}, {"id": 646, "target": "然后领导上台进行讲话，对吗？"}, {"id": 647, "target": "正确，主持人介绍与领导致辞预计持续半小时。"}, {"id": 648, "target": "明白。"}, {"id": 650, "target": "接下来的上午安排包括一场唱歌表演。"}, {"id": 654, "target": "一场歌曲表演。明白了。接着是中午的午餐时间。午餐时间以后......"}, {"id": 656, "target": "关于唱歌这一部分，就像我们之前讨论的，是由谁来演唱，还是参与者自行表演？"}, {"id": 657, "target": "现在需要我再次说明吗？"}, {"id": 659, "target": "想想看，如果你要唱歌，那总不能......"}, {"id": 660, "target": "我们不讨论这个话题。"}, {"id": 661, "target": "所以，你是指我们不讨论唱歌的话题，对吗？"}, {"id": 663, "target": "我现在想讨论的是你之前提出的建议。你提出的那个关于DIY手工艺品的建议非常好。"}, {"id": 664, "target": "是的，确实如此。"}, {"id": 665, "target": "你提议将其纳入游戏环节。"}, {"id": 666, "target": "是，没错。"}, {"id": 673, "target": "关于调整下午的时间安排，我们可以将活动的开始时间从两点调整到一点半。用餐时间定在十二点到一点半。然后，一点半开始进行下午的活动，首先是踩气球游戏。"}, {"id": 674, "target": "是的，踩气球游戏，对吧？"}, {"id": 680, "target": "我们将踩气球游戏安排在一点半到两点半。"}, {"id": 682, "target": "请问你是如何安排踩气球活动的？比如说是一起参与。"}, {"id": 683, "target": "我已经说明过了。"}, {"id": 684, "target": "是两人一组参加，但你觉得......"}, {"id": 685, "target": "我也已经提过了。"}, {"id": 687, "target": "踩气球一小时似乎太长了，正常情况下可能不会这样安排。"}, {"id": 688, "target": "请你参与调整时间安排。"}, {"id": 690, "target": "理论上，如果让一个普通人连续踩气球一个小时，这是不太现实的。"}, {"id": 691, "target": "你认为合适的时间是多长呢？"}, {"id": 692, "target": "我倾向于安排半小时的踩气球环节，并且给予大家两小时的休息时间。"}, {"id": 697, "target": "踩气球结束后，是否会有奖品颁发？除了将奖品颁发给获胜者及集体合影留念这些环节，我们还计划有主持人进行现场互动。"}, {"id": 698, "target": "准备这些步骤大概会占用几分钟的时间。"}, {"id": 699, "target": "即是说，我们不必过于严格地控制时间安排。"}, {"id": 702, "target": "我的意思是，我们应尽可能地把一些有趣的活动，往前提一下。"}, {"id": 703, "target": "那么，DIY手工活动我们应该安排在什么时候？"}, {"id": 708, "target": "有意思的活动？请你说明。踩气球活动可以带动气氛，因为开始时大家的状态是平静的。"}, {"id": 709, "target": "嗯，是这样。"}, {"id": 713, "target": "在工艺活动进行期间会很安静。等到大家热闹起来，主持人讲了一些话后，休息片刻，我们就可以开始DIY环节了，我的安排就是这样的。"}, {"id": 715, "target": "因此，我建议将活动顺序调整，毕竟刚用餐过后，大家可能并不愿意立即进行剧烈的活动。"}, {"id": 716, "target": "然而，参与踩气球游戏并不涉及过多的跳跃。"}, {"id": 717, "target": "想象一下，两个人高高兴兴一起参与踩气球。"}, {"id": 718, "target": "那好吧，那你回头......"}, {"id": 719, "target": "我的倾向是这样的。"}, {"id": 720, "target": "讨论一下，把方案写出来给我，然后再详细谈谈。"}, {"id": 722, "target": "我的偏好是在用餐后让大家稍作休息。这样安排如何？"}, {"id": 723, "target": "哦，你的意思是将DIY手工制作安排在前面，对吗？"}, {"id": 724, "target": "是的，放在前面。因为无论孩子还是年轻人，刚吃过饭谁都不太想动弹。"}, {"id": 725, "target": "嗯，这也是个不错的选择。"}, {"id": 726, "target": "用餐后，大家或许更愿意坐下休息一会，这样也便于一同参与活动。"}, {"id": 727, "target": "是的。"}, {"id": 729, "target": "对于那些喜欢DIY的人，我们可以让他们参与手工艺品的制作，对于不愿参加的人，他们可以在一旁观看别人如何制作，或者选择自己休息一会儿。"}, {"id": 733, "target": "是的，等到休息差不多之后，我们再集体参与跳跃活动，可以相互......"}, {"id": 735, "target": "你认为DIY活动应该分配多少时间？"}, {"id": 737, "target": "在午餐后，大约从一点半开始，DIY活动将持续大约一个半小时。其中，用餐时间大约为半小时至一小时，然后......"}, {"id": 740, "target": "我们休息片刻，差不多在一点半开始渐渐展开DIY活动，持续时间约为一个小时。"}, {"id": 744, "target": "抱歉，我忘记提到，下午我们还将设置一个资料区。我知道漏掉了些内容。"}, {"id": 745, "target": "是的，确实如此。"}, {"id": 750, "target": "下午的活动包含三个部分：首先是踩气球游戏，踩气球游戏及资料区原本是两个活动，根据您的建议，现增加了DIY，因此现在共有三个活动。你认为如何合理分配这三个活动的时间？"}, {"id": 751, "target": "DIY活动将在中午用餐后，从一点半开始，持续一小时。"}, {"id": 752, "target": "明白了。"}, {"id": 755, "target": "到两点半，至于踩气球游戏，大约需要半小时到一个小时。预计将在下午三点左右结束。"}, {"id": 763, "target": "许多人在彼此较为熟悉之后，显示出了愿意参与的意向。对于那些愿意参与的人，我们可以在资料区提供相关资料。而对于不太愿意参与的人，我们还准备了一些年轻人喜欢的活动。或者他们可以选择使用电脑，以此为契机，互相交谈，加深了解。"}, {"id": 768, "target": "不必局限于两人之间的交流，参与者也可以是三人或四至五人的小组，一边享用茶点，一边进行愉快的交谈，互相了解，有些人不一定喜欢单独第一次见面就两个人聊。"}, {"id": 769, "target": "是的，这个环节应该安排在活动的最后进行。"}, {"id": 778, "target": "综上所述，这一环节至关重要。关键是确保每位参与者都能达到一定程度的相互了解，从而减少陌生感。因此，资料区的理想位置应设置在活动的尾声。"}, {"id": 779, "target": "实际上，资料区的位置就是在最后，因为......"}, {"id": 780, "target": "是的。"}, {"id": 783, "target": "无论他们是否决定提前离开，这个环节都不受影响。通过这个过程，他们可以基于相互了解作出决定。让他们相互联系是吧？"}, {"id": 784, "target": "当然。"}, {"id": 792, "target": "所准备的资料旨在促进活动现场参与者之间的相互了解，以加快熟悉的过程。这是为了避免活动显得尴尬或过于安静，我们需要营造一个活跃的氛围。"}, {"id": 794, "target": "是的，要使过程自然而有序地进行。"}, {"id": 796, "target": "我们不希望参与者感到不自在，尤其是避免那种过于刻意的印象。"}, {"id": 797, "target": "我们必须考虑到许多年轻人对那种强制性的社交活动有所反感。"}, {"id": 798, "target": "是的，我同意。"}, {"id": 801, "target": "避免一开始就给人留下相亲活动是必然的印象。我们不需要那样的情景，要让参与者在一开始就感受到轻松的氛围，而不是抱着特定目的来到这里。"}, {"id": 802, "target": "完全正确。"}, {"id": 804, "target": "我们要让活动更加轻松愉快，比如通过观看表演等形式。"}, {"id": 806, "target": "的确，让一切发生得自然。"}, {"id": 807, "target": "毫无疑问。"}, {"id": 816, "target": "那么，就本次活动而言，我们目前的讨论进展到此。至于明日的讨论，我们还需明确讨论的重点内容。明天我们将针对需要进一步调整的事项进行深入探讨。请各位在思考之后，带着观点来参与明日的深入交流。"}, {"id": 817, "target": "届时，请联系我。"}, {"id": 819, "target": "我们需要做出最终决策。"}, {"id": 825, "target": "因此，我们会提供一个解决方案。尽管已基本确定，中途可能会有变更。比如，任何变动可能牵涉到资金问题，请随时联系我协商。可以吧？"}, {"id": 827, "target": "好的，这个没问题。"}, {"id": 830, "target": "我们希望这次活动能够趁着五一节让大家放松和休息，并圆满完成。"}, {"id": 831, "target": "可以，没有问题。"}, {"id": 839, "target": "接下来，讨论可告一段落。请将会议记录打印出来带回。下次会议我们将审视是否有新的修改意见。"}, {"id": 840, "target": "可以，好的，那么就这么定了。"}, {"id": 841, "target": "那我们的会议就结束了，请大家保持联系。"}, {"id": 842, "target": "ok。"}], "description":

142, "target": "在聆听时，我觉得伊基·波普的声音特别好听。然后我发现他编曲的曲调中，巧妙地融入了宝爷那种惯用的曲调走势。在每一个片段，他都有声调上升的唱法，这种音乐表达的方式颇具趣味。"}, {"id": 150, "target": "实际上对于这首歌而言，又让我有所发现，我又提及到歌曲了，反正我就随性而论。我再度察觉到其实りゅういち存在的一个特性，即我认为りゅういち的优势在于其并不太去卖弄技巧，他确实没有炫技之举。于我来看，他参与了诸多合作，也创作了多种类型的音乐，然而我觉得他都达成了，且并未有炫技的表现。我并不太喜爱YMO，我认为YMO似乎存在一定程度的炫技成分，尽管也有那种单调重复的内容，但又增添了一些技法，我当前很难确切地予以描述。不过我认为りゅういち自己进行创作的时候并没有那么刻意地炫技，还是相对更为简单一些。没错，就如同这首歌听起来像是一个较为简单的大概是四四拍的节奏，那个鼓点的敲击声，但我又仔细聆听了一番，其中存在一些小的错拍，这便使得其多了一些灵动之感。并且配器也较为简单，有吉他那种扫弦的音色，还加入了一种具有东方特色的类似扫弦的音色。"}, {"id": 151, "target": "中间段落还有类似琵琶的音色。"}, {"id": 152, "target": "我想说的是，我认为并没有过多炫技的成分，或许更多的是用在了精心的编排方面。"}, {"id": 158, "target": "你提到的这点确实是りゅういち歌曲的一个显著特征，他的编排非常精妙。其实他并不缺乏技巧性，只是这些技巧被他巧妙地隐藏了。因为我的妻子弹了很久的钢琴，现在在弹古典钢琴。她经常和我说在りゅういち的流行歌里就包含一些颇有难度的段落，即便是她这样练了十年以上钢琴的人，在演奏这些流行曲段落时，也没有那么顺手。但是，当你听那个旋律会觉得很简单。"}, {"id": 159, "target": "确实，它的精妙之处在于听起来有着高级的质感。"}, {"id": 162, "target": "好的音乐就是这样，听起来简单，实际上是有难度的。对，他将技巧都隐藏起来，暗暗散发这种魅力。"}, {"id": 164, "target": "所以我估计我跟你有点像。我不太喜欢那些过于炫技的fusion音乐，就是那种乐手过分展示技巧的风格，我个人并不喜欢。"}, {"id": 171, "target": "接下来让我们再谈谈这个MV，你已经提到了一些要点。那么这个MV里想说的到底是什么呢？我们为什么不要提到教授的意识形态方面呢？其实我觉得我们反而应该多看看除去音乐家身份之外的，可能更像艺术家画里的撩人的りゅういち，我觉得他更多的是有一颗想成为艺术家的心。尤其是他晚年的尝试，我们暂且先不提及，比如他砸碎瓷器以后采样声音，甚至在大box里陈列这些瓷器碎片一起送给大家，不是送去出售，而是作为一种典藏型box。"}, {"id": 179, "target": "这个典藏版box，你可以随意敲击它，听听声音，仿佛在创造作品。至于他最后一张专辑，现在并不能定论是不是最后一张，不知道他是否还隐藏有其他作品，目前这张被认为可能是他的最后一张。专辑名字是《12》，专辑封面是由李禹焕创作的。我认为，他的艺术家的骚气远远超过了所谓的意识形态的野性张力，是吧？对。"}, {"id": 180, "target": "我觉得他的所谓意识形态，实际上是他作为一个人的一些价值观念。"}, {"id": 181, "target": "对的，我觉得在所谓的民主国家这很常见，属于个人特质的一部分，没什么特别的。"}, {"id": 182, "target": "对，从我们这边看，这些观念似乎被放大了。"}, {"id": 188, "target":

"target": "这个网站前几年发布了一篇文章分析了这个MV的歌曲，我刚才似乎没有提及，就是伊基·波普与りゅういち合作创作的《Risky》一曲。文章的开篇引用了波德莱尔的话，我不太会翻译，但是的意思就跟鲁迅一样，波德莱尔认为天才的本质是有意识地捕捉童年时的感觉，Childhood就在捕捉到那个东西。"}, {"id": 196, "target": "这篇文章的作者认为这段话恰如其分地描述了りゅういち，我觉得这与我在上期节目中提到的内容有些接近，那就是りゅういち的作品中最重要的是反映出他的纯真以及一种难以言喻的魅力。我相信这背后是他的少年心气或是青春期的特质，这部分特质在我身上也保留了很长时间。"}, {"id": 201, "target": "你觉得随着年龄的增长，りゅういち依然保留了一些少年心态。容我做一个话题外的补充，就是波克老前辈和梁文道做节目之前，在前一期节目中谈到了りゅういち在纽约的某个生活阶段，可能频繁出入酒吧。据身边朋友观察，他有时会进酒吧时与一位女士同行，而离开时又是另一位。"}, {"id": 207, "target":

"target": "关于这个MV，事实上它是由一位才华横溢的英国人执导，这位导演在YouTube上执导了许多重要的MV作。包括像《With or Without You》以及《Where the Streets Have No Name》这样的经典歌曲MV都出自他之手。这次他导演的MV与现代艺术紧密相关，我觉得蛮带劲的。它让我想到了迪金斯教授的风格，采用了一些艺术领域内的经典的视觉引用，并融入了丰富的文化信息。这恰巧也让我想到了，事实上，りゅういち是一个骚骚的人，也是一个想成为艺术家的一个音乐家，很美。"}, {"id": 225, "target": "りゅういち从参与YMO开始，一直到后来出演电影，一直怀揣成为艺术家的梦想。他希望通过不同的方式进行创作表达，同时他的表达欲又刚刚好。正如您所说，他既有强烈的表达欲望，又能够将他所擅长的各个方面，无论是技术还是知识经验，都被他巧妙地隐藏在作品的深层。这是我觉得他特别厉害的一点。正因如此，他最终的作品才能展现出他他既充满少年心气又骚气的一面。"}, {"id": 234, "target": "他并没有让欲望冲动盖过艺术内容，从而造成作品内容的质量不佳，比如某些美术作品。这篇文章提到了整个MV，尽管我们无法确定这是作者的灵感来源还是有确凿根据。其中曼·雷的影响就不过多赘述了，你都很清晰地看到了来自1930年代的曼雷的一些元素，还有一些现代哲学思想。其中提到了一位有趣的人物，大概是60年代，一位美国所谓的哲学家，他是伊朗裔美国人，将自己的名字改为FM2030。他提出了自己的哲学思想，特别是关于transhumanism，trans human是转化的人，超人类的，某种意义上就是所谓的赛博朋克。这可能与当时快速发展的科技息息相关。因此，在MV中，我们似乎看到了一个机器人与一个女性之间的关系，虽然りゅういち偶尔出现，然后这位哲学家在晚年曾提到自己过去的看法，虽然我不太记得他的原话，大致意思是他认为人类应该积极的看待赛博格。"}, {"id": 237, "target": "他的观点我大致理解，就是积极看待赛博格的态度。也就是说，人体可以被机器替代，甚至可能实现永生等。那是那个时代的想法。"}, {"id": 243, "target":

"在所谓的民主国家中，媒体经常被称为三权之外的“第四权力”。我觉得其实在美国或某些欧洲国家的社会环境中，脱口秀喜剧这种艺术形式有时候可以充当某种“第五势力”。可能还不能称之为“权力”，但它能把一些更边缘或潜在问题提出来，亦或者将大家不太愿意提到的一些生活中的问题，尴尬的小矛盾等，带入公众视野。但是在美国的话，脱口秀的话题就相当没有边界了。"}, {"id": 477, "target":

{"id": 515, "target": "对。"}, {"id": 522, "target": "那么他提到了什么呢？他说杭州原本是一个相对小的城市，现在却扩张得非常大。他提到了杭州附近原本都有四季青公社，现在我猜想也是一个卖菜的市场。我不知道你从这个细节中感受到了什么。我最深的印象是，现在有太多所谓的都市年轻人，我可能以前跟你说过，但我觉得这有些危险。我的意思是，实际上大家以前都不是城市居民，完全不熟悉城市生活，不知道怎么生活。在这种状况下，你很容易的融入了现代的城市生活，然后你会发现城市生活有弊端。"},

"这种盲目的流浪带来了什么呢？城市的盲目扩张。原本的城市文化，以及它那可能相对健康的规模并不大。可能那些有机会访问欧洲的人更能理解，一些欧洲城市的规模确实不大。如今却在无限扩张中，我想起了此前访问郑州、武汉、合肥时的印象，其实并不是一种城市文化的扩张，它只是基础设施在不断扩张。"}, {"id": 538, "target":

"我认为这很像我们年轻时进入城市的感觉，似乎触摸到了时髦的都市生活。但实际上，那可能根本不算是生活。因为城市扩张带来了不必要的消耗。例如，城市扩展后，你可能住在离上班地点很远的郊区，每天需要乘坐电车很长时间才能到达工作地点。如果你以前没有在大城市生活过，你可能仍会认为这代表着现代化。"}, {"id": 549, "target": "我居住在卫星城，每天坐地铁上班。这种生活方式看似时髦，但它实际上对人的整体是一种消耗。它并不代表正常生活，但人们往往误以为这是一种现代的生活方式。这样的例子有很多，包括在之前节目中提到的饮食问题，我们现在在都市中的生活方式，让我们对许多事情都一无所知。"}, {"id": 551, "target":

"对，正如你刚才提及的城市文化，我认为过去城市小的时候，所谓城市文化便是分为三六九等，每个人有自己的一个生活范围。而当城市扩张打破了这种范围时，阶层也被打破了，大家的生活也被拉至同一水平线。你之前提到的徐晓峰曾说，过去社会中的阶层差异导致了不同的生活方式，这些生活方式在城市中相互平衡，进而产生独特的城市文化。那么问题来了，你期望过怎样的生活？显然，城市生活并不是简单的等级之分。你想追求哪种生活方式？"},

"还有很多很现实的问题。不过，我认为所谓对生活有的抽象的认知感受，这背后也与教养问题相关。你一定要具备相关的教养，不论是天生的还是后天习得的。有了这样的教养，你才能敢于作出观察、判断，不会轻易随波逐流，缺乏这个你就很难作判断。而知识和见识在某种程度上应该是公共资源的贡献。虽然这是理想化的想法，但我觉得我们普遍缺乏这方面的资源。"}, {"id": 596, "target": "有位前辈评论说，りゅういち的故事缺乏趣味性，我想这恰恰反映了城市生活的枯燥无味。就是那种模糊不清的感觉，人们不知道自己和什么样的人共享这座城市的生活。以前城市体量小，就如千人行新生下的嘉宾所提到的，我觉得西安这样的城市也是如此。它可能在解放后渐渐地也拥有了一个自身的小性格。但随着城市的扩张，外来人口涌入，我认为这些新市民无疑在稀释这所谓的城市性格和生活方式。"}, {"id": 597,

"target": "在这个时候，我觉得大家更需要内省，重新思考自己的生活方式。我们应该摆脱那些在广告中见到、被媒体宣扬、带有进步论意味的美好形象，并且质疑媒体对城市生活场所的理想化宣传所植入的价值观。如果你真的感到无法适应，可能要重新审视反思自己的生活。《锵锵》这个节目很好，为包括古人和一些现代人在内的听众提供了多元的选项，关键是要衡量自己的处境和能力，包括自我认知这件事，这促使我们反思自己的生活方式。回想年轻时，我可能过于天真，充满对未来生活的幻想。现在，我发现这些幻想越来越少。りゅういち已经去世了，我还能幻想什么呢？现实让我连伤心都来不及。我觉得我的很多梦想都已经破灭了。"}, {"id": 619, "target": "说一件夸张的事，记得你在上期节目中评价了我画的那些小小的画，其中一张你觉得有点像木西。我夸张地说，那些作品是大约十年前的画作，那时我认为自己在绘画方面已经达到了尽头。经过那个时期，我感觉自己对于绘画的表达已经无话可说。而其实，正是通过画画，我当时所坚持的一种思想接受了一些微妙的影响。我在反思中形成了新的理念：将个人生活与作品相融合，对生活的态度更认真而开放，用自己的方式去生活，去创作。当然，这样表达可能听起来有些夸大。"},

"这个区域仿佛只是为了拍摄产品照片而存在。"}, {"id": 685, "target": "实际上，那里只有一两栋建筑，并不多。下面全是摆设，行走都颇为不便。"}, {"id": 687, "target": "然后关于西湖周边，在此我就不多言了，它给我的印象也已经有了很大的变化。但至少我知道了美院的南山校区，对吧？"}, {"id": 688, "target": "是的。"}, {"id": 690, "target": "南山校区旁边开始涌现出各种豪车展览和专卖店。"}, {"id": 692, "target": "我以前在杭州的时候，完全没有这种情况。所以这次去时，看到门口全是豪车，我真的吓了一跳。"}, {"id": 694, "target": "天啊，这是怎么回事？居然在美院门口开设豪车专卖店。"}, {"id": 698, "target": "怎么会变成这样？然后我就回了个神，我觉得这地方既有小商品信息，也有暴发户的信息。我感慨道，杭州竟变成了这个样子，如果有孩子，绝对不会让他就读现在的中国美术学院。"}, {"id": 699, "target": "对的。"}, {"id": 705, "target": "绝对不行。Ok。在这样的环境下，你的孩子在美院学习美术和艺术，他到底能学到什么艺术？学完艺术后出来开着豪车去拍小商品照片。"}, {"id": 710, "target": "光明大道以前的美院环境非常优美。首先，校区并不像现在那样布置得像医院。你动动那种方块肉，过去所有的都是那种老式小洋房，教室都设有带天窗的顶楼，地板是木制的，踩上去会发出吱吱声。门外对面就是西湖，四周尽是绿色，周围全是老房子，没有一栋超过三四层的。我认为我记忆里都没有，就很有以前自己印象里的杭州的那种感觉。"}, {"id": 718, "target": "我分享一个印象，不是晴天的杭州，晴天的杭州是亮丽的。而是春夏季节，更加明亮、绿意盎然的杭州。我记得那是一年我从黄山下来，没能看到富春江，接着去了杭州，当时是一个阴天。当时我对杭州的印象是，虽未在西湖边，但那里老旧的房屋，阴天下的黄绿色调，给我一种难以形容、略显陈旧的城市感觉。对，我还曾经问过你，你以前去杭州去得早，我那时问你以前杭州是不是也是一个典型的略有年头的省会城市的感觉，当时你好像说是吧？是不是？"}, {"id": 723, "target": "当时的感觉更像是省会城市，但我认为那时的杭州与我对其他省会城市的印象还是稍有不同。你讲讲不同在哪里？区别就是，我觉得是整个城市显得更加小巧、集中，整体密度相对较高，感觉有很多绿色之中的小房子，与那时许多省会城市不同，它们可能已经有一些建成了相当高的政府机构大楼。而且，也开始建设一些大型广场之类的设施。相对而言，那时候的杭州可能是由于开发较晚，所以保留了较长时间的旧貌。"}, {"id": 724, "target": "提到苏州的老市区，可能会令人想起位于南京总统府附近的古建筑。"}, {"id": 725, "target": "确实，那种感觉更为浓厚。"}, {"id": 726, "target": "现在则是截然不同。"}, {"id": 728, "target": "完全不同。对。"}, {"id": 731, "target": "原本是想探讨古都的概念，我自己也不知道杭州曾是都城。那么你觉得在你年轻的时候去杭州，那里是否拥堵呢？现在我真的看不出任何度量。"}, {"id": 735, "target": "没有，感觉不出。我觉得我们之前似乎都生活在所谓的孤独之中，对吧？之前是这样的。"}, {"id": 740, "target": "实际上，我从小对于“古都”这个称谓仅停留在其名号层面。当你真正生活在那座城市中，很难感觉到自己与古代有任何联系。远的话，就只剩下一些名胜古迹。这些地点大多被围起来，需要购票才能入内，并不是日常生活中的一部分。基本上就是生活在古迹以外的封闭圈子里。"}, {"id": 743, "target": "另外对我而言，所谓的古都文化远逊于西安饮食对我产生的影响。如果你非要我说西安作为古都有什么特色，我自己恐怕都意识不到。这可能也只有外人才能察觉，如果连你也看不出来，那就真的没什么特别的了。"}, {"id": 751, "target": "那我觉得我们两个的感受应该差不多。比如你叫我举例南京本地还保留的文化，我能列举的可能只有一些被认定为非物质文化遗产的事物。但就生活习惯而言，说到南京的传统生活方式，我从小就没有这个概念。因为身边基本上都是外地人。至于所谓的根源问题，我们是按三代算本地人吗？还是再往上算？就没有一个明确的标准。"}, {"id": 757, "target": "而且仔细思考古都这个概念，或者说都城，它们作为古时候的特色。对的，那时候的生活是怎样的？你不了解，我也一样。不论是生活方式，政治经济构架，这些我不了解。还有人文生活习俗，最基本的饮食、服饰、礼仪、语言等，我也对它们一无所知。"}, {"id": 760, "target": "想想徐浩峰所说的北京，从都城变迁至今才多少年，但它的面貌早已变化了。再说西安，告别都城的岁月也很久了，我觉得其特色已经不再显著。"}, {"id": 767, "target": "而且我认为都城的文化可能非常容易被遗忘或丢弃，因为都城本身，除了皇城之外的区域，一开始就是多种人口混杂的地方。你说非常好对吧？因为我之前对京都有一些了解，它作为一个国家的首都，除了皇宫外的那些地方，虽然当时资源并没有那么丰富，但是最好资源都集中于首都了，想要在各个行业进步或仅是为了更好的生存，人们都不得不来到都城寻求机会，就像今天每个人都想到首都淘金一样，资源最集中的地方往往最受追捧。因此，在京都的那个时代，平民中能够追溯到三代都是京都人的并不多见，除了做和果子店的，还有一些的老店和老字号，其实都是外来者。"}, {"id": 774, "target": "您提到京都，京都当年作为都城时，就已经是一个文化混杂的地方。例如，商人是那自赫的晋江商人，手工艺人来自北陆或福井县等地。所以他们本身就是一个文化比较混杂的一个地方。京都本身的文化标志基本上是宫廷文化与平民文化的混合，而这种平民文化又是来自各地文化的融合，形成了所谓的都城文化。"}, {"id": 778, "target": "好，那我顺着你的话题接着聊下去。由于我缺乏亲身经历，于是阅读了大量相关资料后，我突然认识到你的观点是正确的。都城文化融合了宫廷和平民，乃至贵族官宦和平民的各个阶层。我认为，有价值的东西并不在于它是否古老，而是在于这些阶层生活质量好不好，融合是否和谐。说得太对了，还真是这样。"}, {"id": 780, "target": "因此，一个城市之所以富有魅力和活力，正是因为其成功的融合，让它能够持续地发光发热。一旦融合出现问题，城市便会逐渐出现衰落的迹象。"}, {"id": 787, "target": "城市衰落，不仅是由于融合失败，还可能因为古代的人忽视了某些方面，如生育问题、过度的安逸，以及自然灾害、外敌侵扰等因素的影响。这些因素可能冲击政治结构的稳定，从而影响都城的持续活力，甚至导致城市的消失。但如果都城能在阶层融合中出现了杰出或者有趣的人物，它就是一座孕育新事物的温床。我觉得是这样，这一点对于古都尤其有意义。"}, {"id": 788, "target": "是的。"}, {"id": 793, "target": "准确来说，如今的人们去再度发掘古都或许是饶有趣味的。现今的古都已然不再是彼时的古都了，没有了那样的人，也没有了那样的阶层结构，对吧？是的，那些优良的诸如讲究礼仪，包括吃穿住用行等方面，以及做人的基本准则，比如学习什么东西，还有家庭的结构，我觉得这完全体现的是教养，也就是一家人应如何行事，一家人应如何对待上一代，又应如何对待下一代，以及在叛逆方面应该如何表现等等，对吧？"}, {"id": 794, "target": "对。"}, {"id": 798, "target": "乖巧的该如何乖巧，是不是就是整个家庭以及社会层面的这些东西对你产生影响。比如与亲戚该怎样相处，与邻居又该怎样相处？是的，这些都是有一套相应的内容。这些内容逐渐融合之后，就会形成一些非常适合大家共同生存的一套生活方式，对吧？"}, {"id": 804, "target": "的确，这是颇有意思的。而如今已不复存在，现在或许因为我逐渐地认为应该将眼光放长远，导致现在可能处于一个颇为尴尬的过渡时期之类的。总认为如今的这种状态不会长久持续下去。难道你不这样认为吗？就当下我们所说的大城市，暂且不论其艰难与否，年轻人是辛苦的，中年人亦是辛苦的，而且毫无韵味可言，对，老年人就更不必说了。对，读书一点也不适合老年人生活。"}, {"id": 808, "target": "事实上，文化中的潜流是不显而易见的。一张画和一卷长画能分别以六亿的价格售出，但有多少人真正了解呢？我相信，这种状况终将发生改变，尽管我们不知道能否亲见一个更加美好的时代。"}, {"id": 810, "target": "希望是吧？我们都希望能看到一个更好的都市。"}, {"id": 811, "target": "您还有其他想要阐述的内容吗？"}, {"id": 813, "target": "我认为今天我们聊得差不多了。关于都市的话题，我们可以再想想，后续还有机会继续深入探讨。我们甚至可以考虑向东亚文化方向进行拓展，这个东亚就是东边的亚。"}, {"id": 816, "target": "“东边的亚”，这个概念很有趣，期待你的引导。好的，我觉得可以。"}, {"id": 817, "target": "请再考虑一下，我们可以晚些时候再聊。"}, {"id": 819, "target": "可以，那么在今日结束之前推荐一首歌曲吧。好的，能否来一首《末代皇帝》的主题曲呢？"}, {"id": 820, "target": "可以，最后一次演出中りゅういち也演奏了这首曲子。"}, {"id": 821, "target": "放一首《末代皇帝》的主题歌。"}, {"id": 822, "target": "应该是有一首，是吧？"}, {"id": 824, "target": "对，我记得不是很清楚了。然而在我年少无知之时，这部电影是哪一年的作品？"}, {"id": 825, "target": "是8几年的作品？"}, {"id": 827, "target": "那时候就听到这首曲子，这首曲子频繁出现在各种体育赛事中比如滑冰赛事中，就是《末代皇帝》的主题曲。对，还真是这样吧？"}, {"id": 828, "target": "滑冰比赛中经常可以听到这首曲子。"}, {"id": 829, "target": "我曾认为这是中国音乐家创作的中国传统音乐。"}, {"id": 831, "target": "后来，我觉得它像《梁祝》那样，是一种独特存在。"}, {"id": 834, "target": "或者至少，我以为是中国现代音乐家以中国风重新创作的作品，结果我并不知道是外国人的原创作品，然后知道是りゅういち作的。于是我一直误以为是りゅういち创作的，没想到事实上并不是りゅういち的作品。你是知道其创作者是谁的吧？"}, {"id": 835, "target": "我知道不是りゅういち的作品。"}, {"id": 837, "target": "对，我真的想不到实际上是David Byrne创作的。他是Talking Heads乐队的成员。"}, {"id": 838, "target": "Talking Heads乐队。"}, {"id": 839, "target": "这让我十分震惊。"}, {"id": 840, "target": "对，是这么加上限的。"}, {"id": 843, "target": "我之前一直以为他的风格偏向神经质，没想到他能创作出这么优雅的曲子。有时候，或许是我胡说了，有时会把这个音乐渲染成所谓的唐乐。虽然我对唐乐并不了解，不清楚为什么就成为唐乐，但我确实没想到这曲子是他的作品。不知该如何夸赞，今日就暂且不夸赞他了。"}, {"id": 846, "target":

"今年4月，在米兰设计周期间，我参加了一场卫星展的活动，这是一个专为年轻设计师设立的平台，已有二十余年历史。在展览中，我带来了名为“中国谜题”的项目，并希望与大家分享两件作品。首先是一把名为“井字椅”的弯曲木椅，设计巧妙而有趣，可拆卸重组，像玩3D立体拼图一样，让人进行探索性组装。即使有时组装错误，也可以拆开重试，因为这个特殊的木结构，就会使椅子出现一个新的造型，最终再用紧固件固定完成。"}, {"id": 15, "target": "另一件作品是一组由三件物品组成的茶具。首件是仙人掌形状的茶壶，顶部没有开口，茶水需从底部倒入而不会溢出。使用时通过180度的翻转，它便拥有像普通的水壶一样的功能。大家可以去想一下它的内部结构是什么样的。另一件茶壶外型如小鸟，沏水时会发出鸟鸣般的声响。负责调节音量的同志，无需将声音设置得太大。它也在不使用时成为雅致的装饰品。"}, {"id": 18, "target": "最后一件茶具是有杯托配套的茶杯，正常使用时应避免倒入过多的茶水，其实也可以当作普通的杯子使用。然而有句老话说，“满招损，谦受益”，也就是说你在喝茶或喝酒的时候，过于贪杯，给自己倒太多的酒水，就会有意料之外的效果。在贪婪地要求更多的茶水时，会发生一个现象，就是杯子在快满的一刻会悄然从底部流失茶水，等到真正想喝时，却发现杯中已无茶水。"}, {"id": 21, "target": "在米兰展览这套瓷器及之前提及的“井字椅”作品时，有外国观众夸我聪明，并询问我怎么能够想出这个结构。我回应说，这些并非我独创，因为这些有趣的物件在中国古代已有悠久历史，例如“井字椅”的设计启发自孔明锁以及中国古典家具中的十字结合结构。"}, {"id": 28, "target": "这套瓷器的原型源自古代耀州窑，人们赞誉其为“耀祠祀绝”。它原来叫做倒流瓶、公道杯、凤鸣壶还有良心壶，我设计了前面三个良心壶。这些瓷器有点复杂，如在宫廷剧中可见，你与敌人一起喝酒，你给自己倒酒后切换一下手势再给敌人倒酒，就可以给他倒出毒酒。然而，复杂的内部结构令我决定暂时放弃继续设计。目前这些产品仍可在网上购买。由于我觉得原设计可能不符合现代家庭的审美，所以我对其进行了重新设计。"}, {"id": 34, "target": "从工业革命以来，工业设计行业已有近150年历史。在这段时间里，设计领域经历了诸多发展，涌现了许多经典设计。一代代设计师的不懈努力，极大地塑造了我们当今的生活面貌。然而，当我们参观世界各地的设计博物馆时却发现，中国的当代设计作品始终缺席。尽管我们拥有明清家具和陶瓷等文化遗产，但它们通常作为古代工艺的古董被展示在古董或文化博物馆中。在柏林艺术博物馆，我拍摄到了一张照片，在博物馆的角落里明清家具与五彩缤纷的现代主义设计作品相对立的景象，这四张椅子其中有一张还是来自丹麦设计师汉斯·维格纳的作品。"}, {"id": 40, "target": "提及中国明清家具，在设计史上，其对全球的贡献不可小觑。许多现代主义设计大师特别钟情于中国明清椅，并纷纷予以自己的解读。例如，Hans Wegner便创建了以中国元素为灵感的中国椅Y椅，德国设计师Konstantin Grcic使用金属材料重新诠释了中国明椅，而Jasper Morrison、Bouroullecs兄弟以及Philippe Starck等人也都展示了对中国明清家具的热爱，并致力于创造属于他们自己的版本。这一现象展示了中国古代工匠在椅子设计上为世界提供了一个有趣的形式，证明了中国古代人民独特而魅力四射的生活文化。"}, {"id": 47, "target": "然而，对比当代生活，我不禁感到遗憾，认为我们现今的生活方式相对散漫和媚俗。在网上购买家具时，我们常常会遇到“北欧风”、“ins风”等关键词，过去可能还包括“日式”、“美式”、“欧式”、“新中式”等。在我看来，这些仅仅是商业标签，旨在推销一种异域风情。合理的设计无需给自己贴上风格的标签。如果一个品牌仅追逐趋势，它便难以拥有经典的设计，其品牌也不太可能成为拥有百年历史的品牌。如果我们持续不断地追逐瞬息万变的趋势，那么我们的生活文化将难以积淀。"}, {"id": 52, "target": "还有一个关键词就是复刻，山寨产品也十分畅销。以灯具为例，目前中国很少有灯具品牌能通过自主创新生存。有一次，一家灯具品牌联系我，声称可以提供大量复刻欧洲经典设计的原创灯具，他说我可以模仿国外的设计，有趣的是，在交谈中他甚至将“仿”字打错，这反映了他们对仿冒和山寨产权概念的忽视程度。"}, {"id": 56, "target": "以座椅为例，这是我们生活中常见的一个体验。仅需走访一家商场，并在拥有多家餐厅的楼层转一圈，你便能发现这里犹如一座设计博物馆，许多经典设计一览无遗，包括一些设计大师没有做的设计或者没有公开发布的版本也能在中国找到。这是我昨天在商场用餐时随手拍摄的几张照片所捕捉到的情景。"}, {"id": 61, "target": "此外，值得一提的是，Konstantin Grcic设计的椅子如今在中国极为普遍。原本该设计通过铝材一体成型技术与镂空设计来减轻质量，但山寨版本却歪曲了设计师的初衷。不知道设计师来到中国，看到自己的设计如此受欢迎，他会有何感想。"}, {"id": 66, "target": "每年法兰克福消费品展上，都有一个非常有趣的展览名为“Plagiarius”，中文的意思就是山寨抄袭，其奖杯为一个金鼻子小矮人，金鼻子象征的是财富，但是他是通过欺骗得到的这个财富是不道德的。浏览历年获奖名单，可以发现中国成为了该设计奖的最大赢家，自2015年起，几乎每年的前三名奖项中至少有两个由中国获得，2019年更是实现了大满贯。"}, {"id": 72, "target": "近年来，尽管我们看到越来越多的独立品牌和设计师崭露头角，但不健康的市场扩张也在同时进行。山寨现象升级，一些品牌完全源于中国，却能将自己包装成外国品牌，使用外语logo和包装，甚至雇用外国演员扮演设计师，告诉大家何为设计和生活。这让我作为一名设计师感到非常痛心。因为当这些品牌广泛开花，遍地连锁盈利丰厚时，实际上也正是中国设计成长机遇被侵蚀的时刻。"}, {"id": 79, "target": "一些中国品牌已经决定停止模仿，但他们仍难以放弃某些习惯或想法，比如与外国设计师合作推广他们的设计。这属于市场经济的自由，我个人觉得无权干预。但作为一名设计师，我私心认为如果中国品牌和消费者不支持本国设计师，不愿意接受这份风险，那么中国设计师的成长就会受到限制。因此，我呼吁大家支持优秀的中国设计，仔细了解设计背后的故事，不要嫌麻烦去辨别真伪，并讨论其品质。这样，我们年轻一代的设计师才有可能取得规模性的成长。谢谢。"}, {"id": 85, "target": "当然，中国也拥有优秀的设计案例，例如共享单车，它通过智能化方式改变了我们的出行模式。但去年我回国访问客户时，我首次亲眼目睹共享单车带来的景象，深感震撼。街道上已被这些单车占据，几乎留无空地，甚至连盲人道也难以辨认，行人只能在狭窄的空间内穿行。这种场面让我感到十分荒诞，因为我们实在不需要那么多的自行车。"}, {"id": 93, "target": "众多公司为了抢夺市场份额，制造并投放了大量多余的共享单车。许多城市的管理者不得不采取了集中收缴共享单车的措施，同时催促共享单车公司支付罚款金以解决相关问题，随后再让公司将共享单车取回。作为社会成员，我对资源的浪费感到不快。资源本应是公共的，我亦有份，不是吗？因此，看到一个好设计被资本滥用，我感到格外遗憾。设计本是一种工具，而设计师应有自己的立场。基于此，我决定启动一个设计项目，批判这种现象。"}, {"id": 96, "target": "恰好，我有一个朋友在摩拜单车工作，我便联系了他，并在到达摩拜单车后与他们交流，首先参观了他们的维修和回收部门。诚然，摩拜单车的资源回收效率非常高。"}, {"id": 104, "target": "他们将街上损坏的共享单车回收维修，破损的金属部件会被熔解用于生产新的物品。除了自行车“坟场”外，摩拜单车实现了几乎百分百的资源回收利用。到这里我就可以打道回府了。然而，使用自行车部件生产家具的成本并不一定低于新家具，回收效率也不一定高。再加上，产品未投产前，其市场表现未知，因此，如果一个产品是否能盈利都无法确定，那么是否还值得我们去改造它呢？"}, {"id": 109, "target": "这是在我与摩拜单车团队讨论时出现的一个争论焦点。但我后来意识到，它其实也有其它无形的好处，如能引起社会对这一问题的关注，并探索产品的可持续性议题，这是目前并不多见的。因此，我决定自费进行这个项目，无论是否得到摩拜单车团队的同意。幸运的是，摩拜单车也对我的项目表示支持并赞助了我的项目。"}, {"id": 117, "target": "摩拜单车的设计团队向我详细介绍了共享单车的各个部件及其材质和特性。在此基础上，我开始观察和构想，例如，自行车的前叉有一些小的管道可以固定刹车线，同样把它倒过来，也能固定立灯的电线，变成一盏优雅的立灯；自行车车架与人体背部的曲线竟然符合人体工学，只要角度合适，它是不是可以转变为一张美观的躺椅？而自行车的把手则可以被改造成茶几。这辆摩拜单车的前叉是用铝一体铸造而成，配有漂亮的加强筋，可以用来制作一款漂亮的桌面收纳容器。"}, {"id": 122, "target": "随后我便被引荐到了一家金属工厂，在那里驻守了两天，一边进行制作一边予以修改。没错，这是我们当时针对一个椅子所进行的测试，用人肉去测试自然是最好的方式。之后我们将这套家具运至柏林去开展最后的完善工作。最终的成品是这样的，有绿灯、一个躺椅、一个茶几、两个烛台，以及带有摩拜单车logo的桌面收纳盒，后者我予以保留，因其不仅美观而且具有纪念意义。"}, {"id": 131, "target": "在米兰设计周期间，我们租用了一辆翻斗卡车，并将其作为展览场地拉到街头进行游击展览。选择这样一辆卡车的原因是因为翻斗车通常用于运输垃圾或废物，而我们运输的却是被认为有价值的废物。这种冲突性的表现引起了人们的讨论和好奇心。有些观众说想爬上去拍一张照片，我欣然应允，然后我告诉他这个设计背后的故事，有些人会觉得它有双重的惊喜。尤其是共享单车的浪费现象在欧洲并不普遍，所以对于他们来说，了解到中国出现了这一现象，并看到我们对此所做的创造性改造，他们认为非常有意义。"}, {"id": 135, "target": "我的项目最初是出于愤慨而开始的——它是一个具有批判性的项目。然而，在与摩拜单车接触和讨论后，我意识到我们在绿色和环保议题上的目标是相同的，进而实现了合作。摩拜单车也十分给力，不仅提供了零件、场地和宝贵的信息，还给予宣传支持。尽管没有金钱上的资助，所有费用都由我个人负担。"}, {"id": 141, "target": "他们最初对项目可能产生负面影响有所顾虑，但事实证明该项目为他们带来了积极反响。因为人可能不完美，品牌也可能有瑕疵，但坚守初衷并敢于挑战自我是值得尊敬的行为。这个项目我近期也带回了国内，所以在北京设计周期间也将会和大家见面。这个项目是我将无用的东西转变为对我有用的，同样，另一个我在进行的项目，则是探索将有用之物转化为无用之物。"}, {"id": 144, "target": "谈及我在德国学习产品设计之初，我认识了现在的女友陶海月，她专攻公共艺术。是她为我打开了当代艺术的大门，使我意识到当代艺术能够探讨诸如哲学、社会心理等深刻议题，其实是一个强大的沟通工具。与此相比，我当时对产品设计的理解似乎受限，产品设计似乎过于专注于满足需求，而稍有不慎可能就会成为社会经济消费的催化剂。"}, {"id": 152, "target": "英国设计师Justin Morrison提出了Design Pollution一词，这是对当下过度从事无用设计行为的贴切描述。当我们考虑设计新座椅时，必须考虑人体工程学、材料、工艺以及市场的既定审美。真正突破性的座椅设计难度极高。幸运的是，当时我接触到了一种名为推测性设计的理念，由英国设计学者Anthony Dunne跟Fiona Raby提出。他们认为设计既能够提出问题，也能解答回答问题。推测性设计的核心是通过设计展示种种可能的未来，来使我们感受、讨论并为未来做准备。"}, {"id": 155, "target": "我将给出两个例子。2008年，美国纽约现代艺术博物馆的妈妈展，展出了一件名为“无受害者皮革”的作品。该作品通过在培养皿中控制细胞生长的条件，使组织细胞在特定轮廓上生长，最终形成了一件服装。这位艺术家通过作品提出了一个问题：将来我们可能会采用这种方式来生产衣物，那么当我们穿着这种皮草的时候，是否就不会存在动物保护的道德压力呢？"}, {"id": 160, "target": "另一个引人入胜的例子涉及一位著名的英国动物生物学家David Attenborough，他因其为BBC制作的多部纪录片而闻名，可谓英国版的赵忠祥。设计师James Chambers提出了一个假设：如果在另一个平行宇宙里面，David Attenborough没有投身纪录片制作，而是转行成为设计师，他是否会将对动物的热爱和对自然界的观察融入他的设计作品中？基于这一设想，他设计了一款收音机。"}, {"id": 166, "target": "这款收音机极具创意，它能不定时地“打喷嚏”，通过这种方式将内部的灰尘排出。还有就是当不慎有水洒在办公桌上时，电脑可能会因此损坏，但这款磁碟机则截然不同，它会本能地突然站起来，躲避液体造成的危害，十分有趣。我们不禁思考，如果未来的产品能够如动物一般拥有本能，自主避开潜在的危险，是否就能拥有更长的使用寿命？通过这种方式，我们是否能与产品建立起更深的情感连接呢？"}, {"id": 174, "target": "在了解推测性设计几年后，我也进行了一次简单的实践。当时我对手机极度依赖，每天早上起床的第一件事就是摸手机，没有手机在身边会让我感到不安。我觉得我应该通过设计来反映这个问题，受跷跷板的启发，我设计了一款工作灯，必须将手机放入其尾部的凹槽中，灯才会亮起。这迫使使用者在工作时集中注意力，避免手机的干扰。我认为设计中的这种\"不便利\"特别有趣。因此，在我的毕业设计中，我决定将这种\"不便利\"作为灵感，开发一系列产品。正如孔子所说：“良药苦口”，我以此作为我的毕业设计的主题。"}, {"id": 178, "target": "第一个产品名为“愤怒的灯”，它是一盏形似人形的立灯，大家可能也看到过，它有一个很drama的手握住自己的拉线。如果多开了一盏灯、灯光开启时间过长或者至天亮时外面光照进来了，它都会自动关闭。"}, {"id": 181, "target": "“记忆相册”是一个概念性产品，随着时间的流逝，相册中的照片会逐渐变模糊，直至无法辨认。但当你留意到它然后本能地拿起相册触摸时，照片又会变得清晰。通过这个过程，你又得到了重温美好记忆的机会，不是吗？"}, {"id": 187, "target": "“时间杀手”是一个戏剧性的挂钟，其特点是不断“自我切割”的动作，是把时间流逝进行具体化的一个表达。更为诡异的是，当有人靠近时，它会停止运动，假装一切如常。这恰恰反映了时间流逝的本质——常常在不经意间消逝。一旦你离开，它则恢复运动。这使得每次观看这款钟时，都会发现不同的景象，直至有一天它坠落摧毁。"}, {"id": 194, "target": "最后一款产品名为“影子灯”，采用了记忆金属材料，并通过单片机控制其进行随机的升降动作。我的设计目标是探索一种可能性：灯具是否能跳出其作为照明工具的传统角色，为我们提供更多的观察和欣赏的机会。“良药苦口”系列的产品只能叫作品，不能叫产品，因为它们并非批量生产，而是意在引发讨论和启发思考。它们的功能已达到预期效果。"}, {"id": 199, "target": "我想借英国未来学家Stuart Candy在其著作《Speculative Everything》中的一张图表来总结我的演讲。他提出，从当下望向未来，我们能看到众多可能性，它们可分为三种：分别是Possible的未来，Plausible的未来和Probable的未来。尽管在中文中它们均被解释为“可能性”，但这些概念存在着微妙的差异。"}, {"id": 207, "target": "Possible涵盖了所有可能的和不可能的想象，包括极富想象力的场景，如星际殖民和与外星人接触，以及负面性的场景，如全球战争和经济崩溃。 它的模糊性使其难以有效地掌握和准备。 另一方面，Plausible是一个比较合理的未来，代表着我们通过共同努力可以实现的成果，例如消除全球贫困、消除疾病和延长人类寿命。 相反，可能也包括不太积极的方面，例如政党转变和市场波动，促使政府和咨询机构制定策略来应对可能出现的这些情况。 我们相信这些问题可以通过努力来解决。"}, {"id": 211, "target": "Probable未来是最接近我们当前现实的未来，不仅在我们每天躺着刷手机的时候出现，而且以后也可能会发生的问题，比如：人口过剩、环境退化和文化多样性消失等问题，如果不积极努力改变我们的路线，这些问题将持续到未来。 此外，还有一个preferable未来的概念，它是我们期待的想要的未来，不仅希望而且要积极努力实现更美好未来。"}, {"id": 218, "target": "我们的想象力使我们能够观察、提问、实验和实施。 通过设计和努力实践，我们可以实现我们渴望的未来，并将其变成现实。 这个过程体现了设计工作的本质。 我们创造的每一个设计，我们绘制的每一个草图，都是未来的蓝图。 我相信设计可以超越日常审美，能够体现道德价值和意义。 这代表了我理解的设计的顶峰。 谢谢大家。"}], "description":

There is an emerging market for touchscreen LCD remotes that can be programmed in a more sophisticated way or a traditional mode. So you can redesign the interface to suit your needs. You can program in macros and get ABA much greater degree at them. I mean, you can get, in these sort of, you know, 3 and 1, 5 and normals, but you can get different integrations between the different things that are designed to control to a greater degree. For example, you could use a macro to control the TV, you know, turn the TV to the right channel, rewind the tape and the VCR, rewind it, and then play it again, well, it occurs to me that there might be a remote control that could do all of that, but using the traditional button design, and that would put it into a much lower price bracket.

When I was younger, we used to play games by connecting to cable providers through cables, but the traditional remote controls wear out quickly. The remotes are not well-suited for gameplay, so a remote designed specifically for gaming or interactive television might be beneficial.

Furthermore, when it comes to gaming, it is imperative to have large, distinct buttons for navigation in all directions (up, down, left, and right) as well as for shooting. Additionally, the ability to adjust angles in interactive television environments is also a desired feature. You require buttons to adjust the television angle, camera angles, and other related settings. "}, {"id": 129, "target": "As our time is limited, we've got a couple of ideas, we need to work fast. We've got 30 minutes until the next meeting. We need to conclude on the basic functionality and how the user interface will operate.

"}, {"id": 150, "target": "The region was formerly enveloped by a glacier approximately 4,000 feet thick, possibly hosting some moss, but devoid of significant flora or fauna.

It was no exaggeration to say the first ginkgo tree in the area was planted by the great-great-grandfather of Kurt Vonnegut, and I occasionally pass by it. So the Ginkgo is an invasive species since it was not originally from Indianapolis, but ginkgo trees appeared along the banks of the White River up until 2 million years ago. "}, {"id": 158, "target": "Therefore, the ginkgo tree is not native, yet I think it is also considered native. I am eager to hear your perspective. "}, {"id": 162, "target": "Recently, I have engaged in discussions with numerous horticulturists as I embark on a project to plant lots of trees in our vicinity, aiming to balance the environmental impact of having fallen numerous trees in the past.

"}, {"id": 166, "target": "So I'm trying to plant some trees to even the score a little bit. In my efforts to rectify this, planting trees serves as a means to appease St. Peter. Through my conversations with landscape professionals, I have come to understand that what I, as a layperson, view as a clear dichotomy like a white switch that's either on or off between native and non-native plants, is, in the eyes of experts, a spectrum. I find this to be true of many experts, and just as I, as a layman, tend to be a dichotomist who is an expert in the field tend to see it as a spectrum. "}, {"id": 169, "target": "This perspective is logical, particularly given the concept that the Ginko could be considered a legacy entity. Or, Kurt Vonna gets grandfathered.

"}, {"id": 190, "target": "This field of study reached an advanced stage. I recall, distantly from my education, that just before the acceptance of plate tectonics, a comprehensive book was published. It detailed how all the animals and plants were made as a unified theory of movement. Then like a year later, shortly thereafter, geologists presented a simpler explanation than the 1400-page theory of everything.

As a designer, I have chosen to embark on a journey where I encounter novel challenges daily. Inevitably, I encounter obstacles and moments of confusion, but I also find ways to overcome them.

"}, {"id": 58, "target": "The second point is, surely, by now you are aware of it, correct? If you are unaware of your destination and you realize you are late, shouldn't you be clear about what exactly you are late for? "}, {"id": 63, "target": "It's uncertain, but culturally, there has been an expectation. During my upbringing, the narrative was that by 25, individuals were expected to be in a relationship, possibly married, and starting a family. In discussions with my millennial students, they perceive these milestones as being more appropriate for someone around 30, as they can hardly envision life beyond 22. However, it's evident in today's society that people are shaping their lives in a more fluid manner, especially between the ages of 22 and 35. "}, {"id": 69, "target": "The concept of being \"late\" is truly misplaced. It implies a certain level of achievement or understanding that should have been attained by a certain point in time. However, Dave and I, in both our teachings and our writings, should not impose such rigid expectations on anyone. We believe in acknowledging where one is currently standing and building from that foundation. You are not late for anything; instead, the question we really don't like is: Are you striving to be the best version of yourself? Are you settling for something less than your utmost potential? "}, {"id": 70, "target": "Given we're at Stanford, the expectation might seem that we all strive to be the best. "}, {"id": 71, "target": "However, this premise suggests that there exists a singular \"best\" outcome, implying linearity in life, which is far from the truth. Furthermore, this notion harkens back to an outdated business dictum that \"good is the enemy of better, better is the enemy of best. \" While it is indeed desirable to strive for excellence in business, we must recognize that if there is no absolute \"best, \" then the pursuit of such an unattainable ideal can be reframed. "}, {"id": 72, "target": "In fact, striving for the \"best\" is the enemy of recognizing and pursuing all the available \"betters. \" There are numerous potential versions of oneself, each capable of leading to a well-designed life. "}, {"id": 75, "target": "Today, I will share with you five insights drawn from design thinking and the way of five isn't highly regarded by those who have either taken our course or read our book as being exceptionally practical, useful, and beneficial. As human-centered designers, our objective is always to provide aid. "}, {"id": 80, "target": "The first one is the notion of connecting the dots. The concept stands at the forefront of why people engage with our class or the literature we offer. Many express a desire for their lives to be meaningful, purposeful, and cohesive. Research from both positive psychology and design literature indicates that effectively linking who you are, what you believe, and your actions in the world can create a coherent narrative of your life, thereby enriching its meaning. This alignment is the key to experiencing a sense of purpose. "}, {"id": 89, "target": "In pursuit of this, we engage in two exercises. Initially, we invite participants to articulate their personal theory of work — surpassing mere job aspirations to delve into the purpose and value of work in their lives, summarized in 250 words. Following this, we challenge them to define their overarching life philosophy, encapsulating their existential purpose and worldview. Integrating these perspectives into a consistent narrative fosters a meaningful experience of life. "}, {"id": 92, "target": "That's the idea number one. Idea number two: people get stuck and you've got to be careful because we can reframe almost anything. Another common issue is becoming ensnared in what we identify as 'gravity problems. ' These are situations perceived as insurmountable obstacles, deeply impacting individuals' lives. "}, {"id": 98, "target": "Typically, these are circumstances beyond immediate change, exemplified by experiences shared during consultations where individuals express dissatisfaction with aspects of their lives like their job or personal relationships, yet find themselves unable to initiate change. In these instances, it's crucial to recognize that without the willingness to address the problem, it remains merely a facet of one's circumstances. Our methodology in design thinking—beginning with empathy, redefining the problem, ideating, and then prototyping and testing—can only assist if there's an openness to tackle the issue at hand. "}, {"id": 104, "target": "The initial step entails acceptance. Once you have acknowledged a gravity problem, understand it cannot be changed. For instance, consider a family-run company where leadership is reserved for family members, and if you're not in the family, you can't be the president. In such a scenario, you must determine your course of action. Is this a situation you can adapt to, or is it necessary to pursue a different path? It's crucial to approach gravity problems with caution as they are persistent and can significantly impede progress. To illustrate further, I conducted a thought experiment with my students centered on the concept of multiple options. "}, {"id": 112, "target": "I tell my students about the physicists at SLAC who have provided evidence suggesting the existence of a multiverse, comprising multiple parallel universes existing side by side. Have you heard of this? Through a thought experiment, I propose that if it were possible to live in all these multiverses at once and be aware of your life in each, you could simultaneously be a ballerina, a scientist, a CPA, or anything else you aspired to be. This allows for the exploration of multiple concurrent lives. "}, {"id": 119, "target": "When I ask them, \"How many lives are you?   How many lives would you want? \", I get answers from 3 to 10, 000, yet the average settles at approximately 7. 5. This suggests that most individuals believe they have the potential to lead multiple fulfilling lives. However, it is important to recognize that you only have one life, and happiness is derived not from the paths you don't choose but from those you do. This perspective encourages us to embrace the multiplicity within ourselves and embark on an odyssey to discover these varied lives, prompting individuals to engage in some form of design thinking. "}, {"id": 120, "target": "In the ideation phase, the focus is on generating a multitude of ideas. Hence, we encourage participants to ideate not just one future scenario but to conceptualize three distinct possibilities. "}, {"id": 123, "target": "Research conducted by the School of Education indicates that beginning with three ideas and expanding from there results in a broader and more diverse set of ideas. These ideas tend to be more innovative and offer superior solutions to problems compared to starting from a single idea and brainstorming onward. Therefore, the practice of starting with three ideas is consistently applied. "}, {"id": 132, "target": "The concept of exploring three life scenarios seems to possess a unique transformative power. We provide a simple framework for this exercise: firstly, envision continuing your current career path for the next five years with positive outcomes. It is important to note that our approach remains generally value-neutral, with the exception that we aim to enhance, not deteriorate, the current state. I have worked on teams that produced unsatisfactory products, but we weren't aiming to worsen them; our goal was to improve them. Thus, the first scenario should also include achieving personal aspirations. "}, {"id": 138, "target": "You want to go to Paris, to the Galapagos - the place with the ice - before it's all underwater and we can't see it anymore.  So, that's plan one: your life goes great. In the second scenario, we confront a significant disruption: the elimination of your current job due to advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. Now, what are going to do? What do you do if the thing that you've got goes away? And everybody's got a side hustle or something they can do to make that work. "}, {"id": 142, "target": "What's your wild car plan? The third scenario invites you to imagine a life unconstrained by financial limitations. It asks what you would pursue if financial security were guaranteed and societal judgment was of no concern. "}, {"id": 145, "target": "Many of my students visit me during office hours and express a desire to pursue unconventional paths, often prefaced with hesitation due to external expectations. They question whether their aspirations are appropriate for a Stanford graduate, influenced by the assumption that attending such a prestigious institution obligates them to achieve something deemed remarkable by societal standards. But what would you do if you didn't, if you had enough money and you didn't care what people thought anything from I'm going to go study butterflies to I want to be a bartender in Belize? "}, {"id": 151, "target": "These students often conceptualize three alternative life plans, leading to multiple realizations. Firstly, they discover the possibility of imagining three distinct, yet equally fulfilling lives. Although few actually transition to careers as exotic as bartending in Belize, they frequently rediscover passions they had neglected amidst life's demands. By reintegrating these interests into their primary life plan, they enhance their overall satisfaction. While direct pivots are uncommon, this exercise primarily serves as a brainstorming tool for envisaging a multitude of enriching life possibilities. "}, {"id": 159, "target": "Following the ideation phase, our model advocates for prototyping rather than immediate execution. We have observed that abrupt career changes are generally unsuccessful. Our approach emphasizes gradual experimentation by setting achievable goals and reflecting on these experiences. The concept of prototyping involves conducting \"interesting questions\" and challenging assumptions to validate true interests, for example, what would it be like if I tried this? A way to expose the assumptions? Is this even the thing I want, or is that just something I remember I wanted? This includes engaging in \"prototype conversations\" and incremental actions to cautiously explore potential futures without the pressure of immediate certainty. William Gibson, the celebrated science fiction author, aptly noted that \"the future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed, \" highlighting the uneven progression towards realizing one's aspirations. "}, {"id": 161, "target": "Imagine a bartender in Ibiza who has been working there for years. I could potentially meet this individual and engage in a conversation. This concept applies to anyone in our interests, as many out there are already living the future we envision for ourselves. By initiating conversations and asking for their stories, everybody will tell you their story If you buy them a cup of coffee, we often find that people are willing to share their experiences over a cup of coffee. When we encounter a story that echoes our own aspirations, a phenomenon we refer to as narrative resonance occurs, enabling us to identify a clear path forward. "}, {"id": 167, "target": "Another concept is the prototype experience. I recall working with a woman in her mid-forties, a highly successful technology executive who aspired to transition from a focus on financial gain to finding more meaningful work. She contemplated returning to school to pursue a Master's degree in Education and working with children but was unsure about the feasibility at her age. She expressed concerns about how she might be received by younger generations whom she perceived as unwelcoming toward older individuals. "}, {"id": 172, "target": "In response to her concerns, I suggested she immerse herself directly by attending university classes without formally enrolling, to experience firsthand the environment she feared. She followed this advice, covertly attending both a seminar and a large lecture while simply wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with \"Stanford\" to blend in. Remarkably, she discovered her concerns were unfounded. Not only did she find the lectures engaging and stimulating, but she also found the younger students, the millennials, to be rather intriguing individuals. "}, {"id": 176, "target": "I initiated three prototype conversations, and the individuals were intrigued, assuming my interest was due to returning to school at age 45. This provided her with a tangible experience, reinforcing our understanding that we are more than merely intellectual beings. She sensed that this approach could be effective for her, illustrating two methods to prototype your path forward. "}, {"id": 181, "target": "The crucial element in decision-making is ensuring it aligns well with your goals. Many individuals are dissatisfied with their decisions because their knowledge is often limited or unclear. This is especially challenging in today's world, where the plethora of choices can be overwhelming. To address this, we adopt a method stemming from positive psychology that involves the gathering and generation of various options. "}, {"id": 183, "target": "Proficiency in design equates to excellence in creating a multitude of options. It is essential to refine these options into a manageable shortlist. Upon making a well-informed decision, one might still experience doubt or second-guess the choice made. "}, {"id": 191, "target": "A common phenomenon among my students is the \"Fear of Missing Out\" or FOMO. They worry about not selecting the most optimal path. For instance, a student once expressed the intention to pursue three majors and two minors, which is practically unfeasible. Rather than endorsing such an approach, we advocate for making deliberate choices and moving forward without regret. These principles are grounded in psychological research. "}, {"id": 192, "target": "As one becomes adept in generating and curating ideas, it is also crucial to remain open to unexpected, fortuitous discoveries and inspirations. "}, {"id": 201, "target": "Consider the example of Tony Hsieh, the former CEO of Zappos. He sold it to Amazon. Prior to joining Zappos, prospective employees had to complete an assessment measuring their perceived luck on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating a lack of luck and 10 denoting a high level of fortunate occurrences. Great things happen to me all the time. I'm not sure why he wouldn't hire anybody that was not lucky. "}, {"id": 207, "target": "I believe the experiment I am about to describe may seem unconventional, as it drew upon a study where participants were asked to rate themselves from unlucky to lucky. They were then instructed to read the front section of the New York Times, consisting of 30 pages filled with articles. A graduate student directed them to count the number of headlines or photographs, varying by the test, promising a $100 reward for those who identified the correct number. However, the true nature of the experiment lies elsewhere. Embedded within the pages, amidst the various stories, were small notes stating, \"If you read this, the experiment is over; collect an extra $150. \" Interestingly, those who self-identified as unlucky generally succeeded in the initial task, earning $100. In contrast, approximately 80% of participants who considered themselves lucky noticed the additional instructions and claimed the extra $150. "}, {"id": 210, "target": "The essence of this discussion is not the role of luck, but rather the importance of maintaining an awareness of one's surroundings and keeping an open mind to unexpected opportunities. This heightened state of alertness is what facilitates what some may perceive as \"good luck\"."}, {"id": 213, "target": "The concept of choice overload is simple yet profound. When faced with an overwhelming number of options, individuals may go into a psychologist called choice overload, and feel as though they have no choice at all. An illustrative experiment can clarify this point. "}, {"id": 219, "target": "Conducted at Stanford, this experiment involved a setup in a grocery store where a table displayed six varieties of jam, inviting customers to sample and potentially purchase the jams. Under these conditions, approximately 30 customers engaged with the jams, and about a third of these samplers made a purchase. This served as the baseline. The following week, the variety was expanded to 24 different flavors of jam, including unique combinations such as jalapeno, strawberry, and banana. Guess what happens? Look at all these jams, you will find that twice as many people stopped to look at the expanded selection. "}, {"id": 225, "target": "It is fascinating to note that only 3% of people make a purchase when presented with an abundance of choices, effectively leaving them with no choice at all. What should one do when overwhelmed by options? The solution is to eliminate the excess choices. Psychologists have determined that the human mind can manage only 5 to 7 choices effectively; I propose narrowing it down to 5. Once you have limited your options to 5, you can then proceed to make a decision. "}, {"id": 232, "target": "\"What if I eliminate the wrong options? \" one might ask. The concern over mistakenly discarding the right choices is common, yet unfounded. It is akin to deciding between pizza or Chinese food for an office lunch. Initially, there may be no preference, but upon someone suggesting Chinese food in the elevator, you suddenly realize that you preferred pizza all along. "}, {"id": 238, "target": "The realization of one's true feelings towards a decision often emerges only after the decision has been made. This phenomenon has been confirmed through repeated studies. Therefore, one should not hesitate to eliminate options. If a wrong choice is discarded, a gut feeling will usually indicate the mistake. You cannot choose well, only if you choose only from your rational mind. "}, {"id": 246, "target": "Daniel Goleman, the author known for his work on emotional intelligence, extensively researches this area. He highlights the role of the basal ganglia, located in the base of the brain, which processes emotional decisions. This part of the brain evaluates our actions and their resultant emotional responses, whether positive or negative. However, the basal ganglia's ancient position in the brain means it does not communicate with the speech-capable parts of the brain. Rather, it is connected to the gastrointestinal tract and the limbic system, imparting decision-making insights through physical sensations, or \"gut feelings. \" Without this mechanism, it is difficult to make well-rounded decisions, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and moving on from them. "}, {"id": 249, "target": "The most challenging aspect for me was understanding the work of Dan Gilbert, a distinguished scientist at Harvard. Although he is now appearing in insurance commercials, his research focuses on decision-making. And how do you make yourself happy? This brings us to another psychological experiment. "}, {"id": 253, "target": "The postdoc has acquired five Monet prints. Please arrange them from best to worst based on your preference. I adore this one the most, whereas this one is my least favorite. So, the ranking would be: Number one, followed by Number 5, and so on. Thank you immensely for your assistance. "}, {"id": 259, "target": "The experiments are now complete. Oh, incidentally, as you're leaving, the graduate student mentioned that he made a mistake and purchased too many of numbers two and three. So, if you'd like to take one home, you're welcome to. However, there are two conditions. In the first scenario, you can take it home and keep it, but please don't bring it back as I'm a bit embarrassed. It's yours to keep, and there's no exchange policy. In the second scenario, since I have plenty of these, if you don't like the one you chose, you can pay a small fee to swap it and pick another one. Naturally, everyone opts for number two as it's slightly superior to number three. "}, {"id": 263, "target": "A week later, we invited participants to reassess their preferences and re-rank the stimuli. Those permitted to change their minds often expressed dissatisfaction with all the options, including their initial choices. They seemed to dislike the entire process, feeling as if they had forfeited the chance to be content. Conversely, those informed that their selection was final and non-returnable often cherished their prints, typically ranking them as their top choice and holding a negative view of the others. "}, {"id": 269, "target": "The likelihood of attaining happiness significantly diminishes, by as much as 60 to 70 percent, when decisions are reversible. The lesson is to let go and commit to a decision. As designers, generating alternatives is a strength, driving the processes of ideation and prototyping. This approach allows us to gauge whether our creations will lead to a desirable future environment. This absence of fear of missing out is informed by mindfulness of process, which entails collecting information, narrowing down choices, making decisions, and moving forward to achieve contentment. "}, {"id": 272, "target": "The five concepts include connecting the dots to find meaning in work and life, avoiding irreparable 'gravity problems', reframing issues into manageable challenges, and developing not one, but three plans to ensure a comprehensive approach to not just the ideas that you had when you started, but all the other ideas that are possible, prototyping every aspect of your life before fully committing to it. There's no point in making a good or poor choice, and you will find the things in your life are much easier and you can achieve it. "}, {"id": 274, "target": "The efficacy of these methods is evidenced by the thousands of students who have successfully applied them, culminating in two Ph.D. studies that show an increase in self-efficacy and a decrease in dysfunctional beliefs. "}, {"id": 279, "target": "Observing individuals who don't consider themselves creative undergo this class and emerge declaring, \"You know, I'm actually quite a creative person, \" as David Kelly terms it, creative confidence, is truly remarkable.  We know it's achievable.  Thank you immensely.  It's straightforward: cultivate curiosity, engage with others, and experiment.  Do this, and you'll craft a fulfilling and joyful life.  Thank you.
